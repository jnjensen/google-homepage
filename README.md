Started on May 14th, 2020. Begining project after completing the Responsive Web Design Certification from FreeCodeCamp.org. 

Completed a very basic non-functioning replica of the google homepage on 5/22/2020. After learning javascript in more depth, I intend to come back to this page at a later date and upgrade it.
